# whatsapp clone

this project is a mini clone of the famous app.
i started it along with a course on the youtube, but they stopped just after loggin in and sending messages, then storing them in the db.
the messages was stored on a global collection which anyone can acces using thei gmail account.
so i decided to keep going and see how far can i pull this project.
i add the following featurs:

-   users can log in using their google accounts
-   users add other users to their contact list using their google email address
-   user can message each other keeping their privacy
-   each user have his profile picture, it is the one he is currently using on his gmail account

# the tech stack:

-   the famous MERN stack (mongodb, express, react, node.js)
-   redux, and react-redux for state keeping
-   pusher.js to link mongoDB with the client side, which provide a realtime updates on mongo database
-   material UI
